Hospital dapp
1. The Dapp can be used by public with no restriction (i.e., anyone can make an appointment) 
2. The hospital has a lot of doctors and rooms, so there are always some doctors avaialble for every potential appointment (i.e., no confliction happens for the schedules). 
3. Each account can have at most one appointment. It means that if the account does not have a pending appointment, the account can make one if it wants.
4. A patient can also cancel a pending appointment, but only the same account by which an appointment was made can cancel the appointment.
